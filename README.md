# SAMBA (Smoothed imAge MicroBiome distAnce)

 This code is attached to the paper "".
 SAMBA is a novel microbial metric. SAMBA utilizes the iMic method to transform microbial data into images, incorporating phylogenetic structure and abundance similarity. 
This image-based representation enhances data visualization and analysis. Moreover, SAMBA employs a fast Fourier transform (FFT) with adjustable thresholding to smooth the images,
reducing noise and accentuating meaningful information. Various distance metrics, such as SAM and MSE, can be applied to the processed images.

## How to apply SAMBA
SAMBA's code is available at this [GitHub](https://github.com/oshritshtossel/SAMBA/new/master?readme=1) as well as [pypi]().
